* DONE There is some bug in the rating system:
  12:14am is listed as "good" if the green border is at 12:30
  Also listed as "good" when the red border moves from 12 to 11:30pm
  I need some unit testing for this
* DONE The time editor doesn't let me finish entering in the minutes: one press and it goes out
* Fix the preferences screen so it fits on a phone
** The sliders probably need to be smaller, or at least less wide
