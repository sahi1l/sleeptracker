This is a program that keeps track of when you go to sleep and when you wake up.
It uses local storage on your browser to keep track, which means it isn't portable from one browser or another.  You can add entries to the tracker manually.

You can try it for yourself at [https://sahi1l.github.io/sleeptracker/].
